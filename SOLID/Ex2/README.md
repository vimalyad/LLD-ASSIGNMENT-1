# Ex2 — SRP: Campus Cafeteria Billing

## 1. Context
A cafeteria billing console generates invoices for student orders. It currently handles menu definition, tax logic, discount logic, invoice formatting, and persistence.

## 2. Current behavior
- Uses an in-memory menu
- Builds an order (hard-coded in `Main`)
- Computes subtotal, tax, discount, and total
- Prints an invoice and writes it to a file-like store (in-memory)

## 3. What’s wrong with the design (at least 5 issues)
1. `checkout.CafeteriaSystem.checkout` mixes menu lookup, rules, tax rules, discount rules, printing, and persistence.
2. Tax rules are hard-coded and not extensible.
3. Discounts are hard-coded with ad-hoc conditions.
4. Invoice formatting is mixed with money calculations.
5. Persistence is a concrete class; hard to test without writing.
6. `Main` depends on too many internal details.

## 4. Your task (refactor plan)
Checkpoint A: Run and capture output.
Checkpoint B: Separate rules/tax/discount computations into dedicated components.
Checkpoint C: Move invoice formatting out of `checkout.CafeteriaSystem`.
Checkpoint D: Introduce small abstractions to decouple persistence and rules.
Checkpoint E: Keep output identical.

## 5. Constraints
- Preserve exact invoice text and line order.
- Keep `entities.MenuItem` and `dto.OrderLine` public fields unchanged.
- No external libraries.

## 6. Acceptance criteria
- `checkout.CafeteriaSystem` orchestrates only; it should not format strings or encode tax/discount specifics.
- Adding a new discount should not require editing a long method.

## 7. How to run
```bash
cd SOLID/Ex2/src
javac *.java
java Main
```

## 8. Sample output
```text
=== Cafeteria Billing ===
Invoice# INV-1001
- Veg Thali x2 = 160.00
- Coffee x1 = 30.00
Subtotal: 190.00
Tax(5%): 9.50
Discount: -10.00
TOTAL: 189.50
Saved invoice: INV-1001 (lines=7)
```

## 9. Hints (OOP-only)
- Keep “rules” behind interfaces so new rules can be added without editing a big method.
- Keep formatting as a separate responsibility.

## 10. Stretch goals
- Add a second invoice for a staff member with different discount policy.
